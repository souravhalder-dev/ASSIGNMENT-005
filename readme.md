 What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?
   
getElementById() Used to specifically find an HTML element by its id.getElementsByClassName() Finds multiple elements using a class name and allows you to work with them easily.querySelector() Finds the first element that matches a given CSS selector (id, class, tag, etc.).querySelectorAll() Used to find multiple elements (id, class, tag, etc.) and returns them as a NodeList.


 How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?
Create with document.createElement('tag'), set attributes/content, and insert using parent.appendChild(element) or parent.insertBefore(element, reference).

What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?
When an event triggers on an element and propagates up through its parent elements in the DOM, triggering handlers on each.

 What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?
 Attaching a single event listener to a parent element to handle events for its children, using event bubbling.
Why Useful: Reduces memory usage, simplifies code, and handles dynamically added elements.


What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?
preventDefault() Stops the default browser action (e.g., form submission, link navigation) without affecting event bubbling.
stopPropagation() Prevents the event from bubbling up or capturing down the DOM, but doesnâ€™t stop default actions.
Example: e.preventDefault() stops a form submit; e.stopPropagation() stops parent handlers from firing.
